# Dice Simulation and Data Analysis
## Overview
This project involves simulating various dice rolls using Python and analyzing the results through data visualization. The aim is to showcase essential data analysis skills, including data collection, frequency analysis, and interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.

Each script simulates rolling different types of dice (D6, D8, D10, etc.), storing the results, and visualizing the distribution of outcomes. This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, data manipulation, and visualizationâ€”key skills for a data analyst role.

## Skills Demonstrated
Data Collection: Generated datasets through simulations by rolling dice and storing the results.

Data Analysis: Calculated frequencies of each outcome to understand the distribution of results.

Data Visualization: Created interactive and static visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.

Python Programming: Demonstrated proficiency in Python through list comprehension, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data manipulation.

## Key Features
### Dice Rolling Simulation:
Simulates rolling one or more dice with varying numbers of sides.

Generates results from thousands of dice rolls to analyze distribution patterns.
### Frequency Analysis:
Calculates the frequency of each possible result.

Visualizes the frequency distribution of dice roll outcomes using bar charts.
### Data Visualization:
Visualizes results using Plotly for interactive charts and Matplotlib for static charts.

Customizes charts with labels, titles, and enhanced visuals.

## Future Improvements
Statistical Analysis: Perform additional statistical analysis on the results (e.g., calculating mean, variance).

Real-Time Data: Incorporate real-time simulations and allow user input to customize the number of sides and rolls.

Dashboard Integration: Create a web-based dashboard to allow users to run simulations and view results dynamically.

## How to Run the Project
### Clone the Repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/your-username/dice-simulation-analysis.git

cd dice-simulation-analysis

### Install Dependencies:

### Install the required Python packages:

bash

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the Simulation Scripts:

To simulate dice rolls and visualize the results, run any of the provided scripts. For example:

bash

Copy code

python die_visual.py

This will generate a visualization of rolling a D6 die 1,000 times.
