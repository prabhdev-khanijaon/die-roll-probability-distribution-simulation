# Die Roll Probability Distribution Simulation
# Overview
Welcome to the Die Roll Probability Distribution Simulation project! This repository contains a Python application that simulates rolling a die and analyzes the probability distribution of the outcomes. The project utilizes Matplotlib and Plotly to create both static and interactive visualizations, providing insights into basic probability concepts and their applications.

# Project Motivation
Understanding probability distributions is fundamental in statistics, data science, and various real-world applications like risk assessment, game theory, and decision-making processes. This project aims to:

Demonstrate how random events can be simulated using programming.

Visualize the outcomes to understand the uniform probability distribution of a fair die.

Provide a foundation for exploring more complex probability models.

# Features
Simulation of Die Rolls: Customize the number of rolls to simulate large datasets.

Statistical Analysis: Calculate frequencies, relative frequencies, and statistical measures like mean and variance.

Data Visualization:

Matplotlib: Generate static histograms and bar charts.

Plotly: Create interactive charts that allow for data exploration.

Customizable Parameters: Easily adjust the number of rolls and sides of the die.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.12.3

Matplotlib: For static data visualization.

# Potential Applications
Education: Teaching basic concepts in probability and statistics.

Game Development: Simulating dice rolls for games.

Risk Assessment: Understanding random events and their distributions.

Data Science Foundation: Building intuition for probability distributions and statistical analysis.
Plotly: For interactive data visualization.
